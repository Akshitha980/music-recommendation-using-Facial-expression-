# music-recommendation-using-Facial-expression
## 📌 Project Overview
This project recommends music based on the user’s facial expression. 
The system detects emotions using a trained facial emotion recognition model 
and suggests songs accordingly.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Collect facial image data.
2. Train emotion detection model.
3. Detect user emotion through camera.
4. Recommend songs based on detected emotion.
